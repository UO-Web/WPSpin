tar xfz *z

cd libevent-1.4.13-stable
./configure; make
sudo make install

cd ../memcached-1.4.5
./configure; make
sudo make install

cd ../libmemcached-0.43
./configure; make
sudo make install

cd ../memcached-1.0.2
phpize
./configure; make
sudo make install
# make install says something like:
# Installing shared extensions: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/
# so add the path to the new memcached.so to /etc/php.ini, e.g.
extension=/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626/memcached.so

sudo apachectl graceful
php -i | grep memcache

To run memcached automatically as a daemon, edit the job file:
    /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.danga.memcached.plist
and modify the value of Disabled to false. Make any other changed you need (see
memcached(8) for options) and then:
sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.danga.memcached.plist
The daemon should start automatically during system boot.
